SAMPLE PROJECT MANIFEST FORMAT

The "project manifest" uses
[Config::Std](https://metacpan.org/module/Config::Std) syntax.  When the
[App::JenkBuilder::Project](http://tinyurl.com/mprksdp) object loads the
project manifest config file, it creates a
[App::JenkBuilder::Job](http://tinyurl.com/mhglerb) object that represents the
job that this project is trying to build.  Any dependencies of this job job
are also stored in the `Project` object as `App::JenkBuilder::Job` objects.
See the documentation for the `Project` and `Job` objects for more information
on object methods and attributes.


    [PROJECT]
    name : <project name, same name as the corresponding Jenkins job>
    version : <job version>
    build_arch : <build architecture>
    deps : (build dependencies; repeat "deps" lines as many times as needed)
    deps : (order matters, deps list gets built from top to bottom)
    deps : (format of deps line: "deps: dep_name, dep_version")
    deps : <dep_job_name>, <dep_job_version>
    deps : project-x, 1.00
