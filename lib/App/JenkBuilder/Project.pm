=head1 NAME

App::JenkBuilder::Project - Describes how to build a given "project",
or a collection of jobs in C<Jenkins> that are combined to build a final
product.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Describes how to build a set of Jenkins jobs.

    use App::JenkBuilder::Project;

    my $project = App::JenkBuilder::Project->new(config => $config);
    print q(Project: ) . $project->name() . q( has );
    say scalar($project->deps()) . q( dependencies.);
    ...

=head1 OBJECT ATTRIBUTES

=head2 project_job

C<App::JenkBuilder::Job> object that is the focus of the "project".

=cut

has project_job => (
    is  => q(rw),
    isa => q(App::JenkBuilder::Job),
);

=head2 build_deps

C<App::JenkBuilder::Job> objects that are required to build C<project_job>.

=cut

has build_deps => (
    is  => q(rw),
    isa => q(ArrayRef[App::JenkBuilder::Job]),
);

=head2 build_arch

Build architecture for building this project.  This value would be used to
determine what cross-compilers (if any) to use when building individual jobs.

=cut

has build_arch => (
    is  => q(rw),
    isa => q(Str),
);

has _project_config => (
    is  => q(rw),
    isa => q(HashRef),
);

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 load(config_file => $filename)

Loads the file passed in as C<config_file> and tries to parse it.  The format
of the configuration file is described in the
L<Config::Std|https://metacpan.org/module/Config::Std> module.

=cut

        push(@build_deps,
            App::JenkBuilder::Job->new(
                name    => $name,
                version => $version,
            )
        );

    # - number of dependencies?
    # - project job?
